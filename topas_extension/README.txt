Here is the extension of TOPAS Monte Carlo for 'modified' MKM-based ion dose calculation.
We can recalculate specific energy distribution based on the pre-calculated MKM table and dose averaged method.
You can find the detailed whole process of these methods(2015, Inaniwa)

We utilized the existing extension of ProtonRBE(https://github.com/topasmc/extensions/tree/master/ProtonRBE)
If we added the MKM table data on "CellLineXXX.txt", you can caculate dose-mean specific energy per voxel.
The MKM table data can be generated by the method in elsewhere (2010, Inaniwa)
We attached example for scoring specific energy.

For instructions on how to use TOPAS extension, refer to the TOPAS official website.

You can create your own MKM table through various stopping power sources.
If you have any questions about the MKM table, please contact us by email. (xmfla0803@gmail.com)
