# matRad_MKM-extension

This code is an extension of the open-source toolkit, matRad.
This extension enables the microdosimetric kinetic model (MKM) based biological dose calculation.

ANYONE can use this extension with no permission.
The redistribution strategy is affected by the GPLv3 license. Please check the License.md file.

You can use this extension by just replacing or adding the file into the matRad toolkit,
then it can be tested by the MKMtest script file.
For optimizing fluence based on MKM, sequential process is depicted with short description.

The improvement of code performance will also proceed.
The present extension is rather slower than the original matRad biological dose calculation algorithm.
But, The MKM-based biological dose calculation result is no problem and is still available.
